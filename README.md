The SLM-Based Construction Plan Generator is an intelligent system designed to automate architectural blueprint generation from user-provided natural language descriptions. Using a combination of Structured Language Models (SLMs), prompt parsers (X), architectural rule engines (Y), and layout/visualization generators (Z), the system transforms inputs like "3 BHK house with 2 bathrooms on 1200 sqft" into structured formats (JSON/YAML), which are then processed to produce 2D floor plans and optional 3D models. The X component parses and structures textual input, the Y component applies spatial logic and building constraints to synthesize a coherent floor layout, and the Z component renders the final output as SVG/DXF blueprints or 3D visualizations. This solution can be extended with regulatory compliance checks, BIM integration, and multi-language support, making it ideal for architects, real estate platforms, and smart construction systems.
